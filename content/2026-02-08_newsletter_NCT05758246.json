The central hypothesis is that a threshold burden of SnCs predisposes to a SASP mediated dysfunctional response to PAMPs, contributing to a disproportionate burden of sepsis in older patients. The study hypothesizes timely treatment with fisetin will interrupt this pathway.\n\nA multicenter, randomized, adaptive allocation clinical trial to identify the most efficacious dose of the senolytic fisetin to reduce the composite cardiovascular, respiratory, and renal sequential organ failure assessment score at 1 week, and predict the probability of success of a definitive phase III clinical trial.",
